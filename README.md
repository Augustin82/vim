# How to use

- Clone this repo/branch somewhere (I use `$HOME/.vim`);
- Edit your `$HOME/.config/nvim/init.vim` file and add that line at the end: `source $HOME/.vim/init.vim` (or wherever you put it);
- start nvim; CoC should try and install some extensions by itself;
- open some Elm file; basic stuff like completion suggestions and jump-to-definition (`gd`) should work.
